## STEP 1: Deploy Backend to Railway (5 minutes)

### Go to Railway.app and Deploy

1. **Visit**: https://railway.app
2. **Sign up** with GitHub (sibusis-code)
3. **Click**: "New Project"
4. **Select**: "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. **Choose**: `sibusis-code/spaza-track`
6. **Click**: "Deploy"

Railway will auto-detect Python and start building!

### Wait for Build to Complete
- Should take 2-3 minutes
- Check "Deployments" tab
- ✅ When green, it's live!

### Configure Environment Variables

1. In Railway dashboard, go to your project
2. Click the **service** that was created
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. **Add these variables**:

```
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./spaza.db
SECRET_KEY=spaza-prod-2026-super-secret-key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=10080
CORS_ORIGINS=https://sibusis-code.github.io/spaza-track,http://localhost:8080
```

> If you prefer Postgres or MySQL, set DATABASE_URL accordingly and apply migrations.

5. Click "Update variables"
6. Redeploy (click "Redeploy latest")

### Create Admin User

**Create Admin on Railway**

Use the Railway CLI (recommended):
```powershell
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway link  # select spaza-track
railway run python backend/create_admin.py
```

If you prefer automation, add env var `CREATE_ADMIN_ON_STARTUP=true` and redeploy; startup will seed admin once.

### Get Your Backend URL

1. In Railway, click your service
2. Look for **"Domains"** section
3. Copy the Railway URL

**It looks like**: `https://spaza-track-prod-abc123.railway.app`

---

## STEP 2: Update Frontend API URL

1. Open `api-client.js`
2. Set `API_BASE_URL` to your Railway domain, e.g. `https://spaza-track-prod-abc123.railway.app/api`
3. Save, commit, and push.

---

## STEP 3: Enable GitHub Pages for Frontend

1. Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/sibusis-code/spaza-track
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. Click **"Pages"** (left sidebar)
4. **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
5. **Branch**: Select `master`
6. **Folder**: Select `/ (root)`
7. Click **Save**

Wait 2-3 minutes...

Your frontend will be at:
**https://sibusis-code.github.io/spaza-track/**

---

## STEP 4: Update CORS in Backend

1. Go back to Railway dashboard
2. Click your service
3. Go to **"Variables"**
4. Find `CORS_ORIGINS`
5. Update it to include your GitHub Pages URL:
```
CORS_ORIGINS=https://sibusis-code.github.io/spaza-track,http://localhost:8080
```

6. Click "Update variables" → "Redeploy"

---

## STEP 5: Test Everything!

### Test Backend API

Open in browser:
```
https://spaza-track-prod-abc123.rail   way.app/api/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2026-01-22T..."}
```

### Test API Documentation

Open in browser:
```
https://spaza-track-prod-abc123.railway.app/docs
```

You should see Swagger UI with all endpoints!

### Test Frontend

Open in browser:
```
https://sibusis-code.github.io/spaza-track/login.html
```

**Try to login** with:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**It should work!** ✅

## 🎉 YOUR LIVE URLS

**Backend API**:
```
https://spaza-track-prod-abc123.railway.app/api
```
(Replace `abc123` with your actual Railway URL)

**Frontend**:
```
https://sibusis-code.github.io/spaza-track/
```

**API Documentation**:
```
https://spaza-track-prod-abc123.railway.app/docs
```

**Login Page**:
```
https://sibusis-code.github.io/spaza-track/login.html
```

## 🗄️ Database Location

**SQLite database** (`spaza.db`):
- **Stored**: On the Railway server filesystem
- **Backed up**: Daily by Railway
- **Location**: `/app/backend/spaza.db`
- **Size limit**: 500MB (can handle 100,000+ records)
- **Cost**: FREE (included in Railway)

**How it works**:
1. User logs in on GitHub Pages (frontend)
2. Frontend sends login to Railway backend API
3. Backend validates against SQLite database
4. Backend returns JWT token
5. Frontend stores token, uses for all future requests
6. All data flows through Railway backend
7. SQLite stores everything safely

- Check "Deployments" → "Logs"
- Look for errors

### Can't login?
- Check admin user was created
- Check `api-client.js` has correct URL
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Check CORS settings in Railway

### GitHub Pages showing old version?
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- Clear browser cache
- May take 2-3 min to deploy

### Database not found?
- In Railway terminal:
  ```
  python backend/create_admin.py
  ```
- Check DATABASE_URL in variables
